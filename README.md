# This repository is a compilation of different small projects I've done with FastAPI during my learning process. I update it regularly with new projects.

Here is a list of projects here.

## 1. RESTFUL CRUD API
---
This is a simple RESTful CRUD API made with Python's FAST API framework. It allows a user to enter a 
- name (String)
- age (Integer)
- message (String)
- createDate (Date)

As a CRUD API, records can be created, read, updated and deleted. In this project, only the message can be updated. It is connected to a sqlite database.

## 2. Sign Up App
---
This is an endpoint that receives user data. It also has some data validaion.
